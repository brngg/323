On the eighty fifth day 
end of text line
of his unlucky streak, Santiago 
end of text line
takes his skiff into the 
end of text line
Gulf Stream, sets his lines 
end of text line
and by noon, has his 
end of text line
bait taken by a big 
end of text line
fish that he is sure 
end of text line
is a marlin. Unable to 
end of text line
haul in the great marlin, 
end of text line
Santiago is instead pulled by 
end of text line
the marlin, and two days 
end of text line
and nights pass with Santiago 
end of text line
holding onto the line. Though 
end of text line
wounded by the struggle and 
end of text line
in pain, Santiago expresses a 
end of text line
compassionate appreciation for his adversary, 
end of text line
often referring to him as 
end of text line
a brother. He also determines 
end of text line
that, because of the fish's 
end of text line
great dignity, no one shall 
end of text line
deserve to eat the marlin.

On the third day, the 
end of text line
fish begins to circle the

skiff. 
The total string count is 116.
